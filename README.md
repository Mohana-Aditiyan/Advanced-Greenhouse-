 The project transforms the tomato industry by addressing irregularities and promoting sustainability through IoT-based smart greenhouses and solar desalination. This improves crop quality, productivity, and agri-food security while reducing post-harvest losses. Precise environmental controls enhance efficiency and support sustainable development.
# ABSTRACT
Advanced greenhouse techniques for sustainable yield optimization and value-added product innovation in tomato industry through solar dehydration outlines the key elements and objectives of the proposed program The project aims to overcome challenges faced by the tomato industry, irregular yields, sustainable agriculture An overview of the practices and requirements of the proposed systems, including Internet of Things based smart greenhouse frameworks and control strategies. This system allows environmental conditions to be precisely monitored and controlled in the greenhouse, tailoring them to the specific requirements of the crop. Utilizing Internet of Things technology, the system aims to improve crop quality and increase yields, contributing to sustainable agri-food security. Additionally, the abstract highlights the use of solar dehydration as a valuable innovation resource in the tomato industry. Solar absorption provides a sustainable method of storing and processing tomatoes, reducing post-harvest losses and adding value to the final product Integration of solar absorption in strategies a advanced weatherization is consistent with the projectâ€™s objective of sustainable yields.
